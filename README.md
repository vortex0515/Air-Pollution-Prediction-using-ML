# Air-Pollution-Prediction-using-ML

Air pollution stands as a primary cause of mortality worldwide, with brick kilns significantly contributing to its exacerbation. Unlike other pollution sources, monitoring brick kilns proves challenging. 
Conventional survey-based methods for kiln identification are both costly and time-consuming. This project proposes the implementation of computer vision and machine learning models to efficiently detect brick kilns using low-label satellite imagery. 
Through this approach, we aim to revolutionize kiln monitoring, contributing to effective pollution control and public health preservation.
